Hello to our Grader,

We hope you are having a wonderful day. Just wanted to let you know how the songs are loaded into the application.
We have provided a text file named songs.txt, please do not change the name of this file. It has to remain songs.txt.
If you decide to move the file anywhere, the code would need to be updated to know the path to that file, so unless needed
refrain from that as well.
The songs in the songs list are delimited by a |, so if you are adding custom songs directly to the file delimit them accordingly.
The order goes: song name|artist name|album name|year
There are no spaces between the | character. 
Everything else is taken care of by the code, meaning any insertions to the song list, deletions, and updates will be reflected 
on the text file even between sessions. 
A song that is inserted that has no album indicated will have an album named "No Album".
In addition, the preset year if a year is not inserted is 0.
Lastly, when exiting the application please use the exit 'x' button on the gui on the top right, as you would a normal window.
Thanks for reading, and have a great day!

Sincerely,
Muhammad and Kevin
